# dsc106-final-project

This is the final project of DSC106 creating a dashboard presenting suicide rate from 2005 to 2015.

The main tools we used are HighCharts, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python

Best thanks to the demos and api on HighCharts and HighMap, and Professor Powell and the TAs for providing us suggestions.

The limitations of the project are
1) the style to make the theme related to suicide.
2) The dataset does not present all the countries around the world.
3) We graphed more than 4 charts in the beginning and was suggested to truncate to 4 graphs.
